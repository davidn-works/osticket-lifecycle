- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Key Phases of the Ticket Lifecycle</h2>

- Intake
- Assignment and Communication
- Addressing the Problem
- Resolution

<h2>Detailed Lifecycle Steps</h2>

<p>
To begin, we will create a new support ticket. Upon creation, specific details must be provided: the user's email address, full name, an optional phone number, and selection of a relevant Help Topic. Recalling the Help Topics set up in the prior lab, we will select "Password Reset" for this example. Following the topic selection, a clear description of the problem is needed, for instance, "Multiple login attempts have failed." Once all necessary information is entered, clicking the "Submit" button concludes the initial intake phase.

The subsequent step involves logging in as a support agent to access the submitted tickets. We'll use the agent profile for Jane Doe, established in the preceding lab exercise, for demonstration. After successful login, the ticket can be assigned. Typically, a queue manager performs this assignment, but in this exercise, Jane (acting as system admin) will handle it. Navigate to the "Priority" setting to define the urgency level. Priority levels span from low (requiring less immediate attention) to Emergency (demanding urgent resolution due to potential significant business impact). For this particular ticket, we will assign a "Normal" priority. Further down, notes can be added detailing the resolution steps, any changes in assignment, or other relevant information useful for tracking the ticket's progress.

Lastly, once all relevant notes are recorded and the issue has been addressed, the Ticket Status should be updated to "Resolved", allowing the ticket to be formally closed. Excellent work! Throughout the recent lab sessions, we've accomplished the installation and configuration of all prerequisites and examined the complete lifecycle of a support ticket. Great job!
